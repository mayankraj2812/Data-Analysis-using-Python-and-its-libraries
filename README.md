Project: Data Analysis and Visualization in Python

Description: In this project, I performed data analysis using Python to extract actionable insights from a raw dataset. Key steps involved data cleaning, transformation, and comprehensive visualization using Python libraries.

Data Cleaning & Preparation: I used Pandas and NumPy to handle missing values, filter out anomalies, and restructure data for analysis.
Analysis & Insights: By leveraging data manipulation techniques, I identified trends, correlations, and patterns in the dataset, uncovering key insights.
Visualization: I created clear, impactful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate findings effectively. Visuals included bar plots to highlight data relationships and trends.
This project showcases my skills in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and visualization, emphasizing the importance of data-driven decision-making.
